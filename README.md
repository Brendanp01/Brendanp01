# Hi!
I'm Brendan. I write code. 50 hours a week. Kinda crazy.
# What I'm working on
I'm currently working on DroidMod, an Android modification program which will include features for sideloading apps, modifying boot logos and images, accessing root file system, and eventually an API for other Windows programs to interact with Android devices.
